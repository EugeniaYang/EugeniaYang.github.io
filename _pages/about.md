Hi! My name is Ziqi Yang 杨子祺. I am a Master's student at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor majoring in User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction. 

I will be graduating in December 2023 and **I am actively looking for research opportunities and applying for 24Fall PhD programs in HCI.**

I gradutated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022. I also took electives in Industrial Design and social sciences from SJTU School of Design and University of California, Berkeley. 

My research interests lie broadly in HCI, involving human-AI collaboration, social computing and accessibility for health and well-being, computer supported collaborative work, and education practices.
